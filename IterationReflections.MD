# Reflections on each Iteration

## Iteration 1
### What worked well
- We were able to define the requirements of the project and outline our criteria that the end product should have.
- We were able to decide on the tools we would be using and how the architure of the project will end up looking.
- We were able to research the different areas of our architecture in order to generate future work that implements key requirements.
### What did not work well
- We had a lack of communication coming out of the gate that limited the ability to make progress on the project. This also prevented team members from sharing the work they were doing on the architecture spike stories.
- We had a steeper learning curve for the planned technologies than we had expected. Web development and the recommendeed tech stack was not particularly familiar to any team member, so this has required more footwork on understanding our tools.
